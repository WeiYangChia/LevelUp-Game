Hi! This is our game for CZ3003 Software System Analysis and Design. 

## How to Play

1. Sign Up/Log in
2. Read the "How to Play" instructions before clicking "Play"
3. If there is an existing room you would like to join, key in the room code in the Create/Join Room menu. If not, create a room by inputting the room size and selecting the desired difficulty and category.
4. Click 'Customize' after you have joined the room to customize your avatar.
5. Based on your achievement points, you will have access to some characters. Also, some colours might be taken by other players so you won't be able to select it. Select a character + colour to create your avatar. After you are done, click 'Confirm'. If you want to change your colour/character, you have to select on your current one to deselect it first.
6. If you are the host, select a map.
7. After all players have created their avatars and the host has selected a map, the host can start the game.
8. The controls available are arrow keys and 'WASD' to move the player, 'Ctrl' to zoom out, and 'Z' to activate the power-up.
9. In the game, there will be two types of blocks: White blocks (Power-ups) and Colored blocks (Earn points).
10. To gain a power-up, go to the white blocks and answer the question correctly. 
11. To earn points, go to the blocks that are of your colour. (E.g. green blocks if your colour is green) to activate it and answer the question correctly.
12. After 2 minutes, the game will automatically end, and you are ranked based on the number of points you earned.
